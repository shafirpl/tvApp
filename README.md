# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone the project, go to the directory and run the command either in a terminal or command prompt "yarn", then run the command
"yarn start". The app will be serving then.

The app can also be accessed at: http://138.68.61.175:3000/
